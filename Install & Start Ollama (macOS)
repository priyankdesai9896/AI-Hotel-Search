Install & Start Ollama (macOS)

Download & install

Go to https://ollama.com/download

Download the macOS .dmg installer

Drag Ollama.app to your Applications folder

Start Ollama server

Launch Ollama.app from Applications (it runs a background server at http://localhost:11434)

You should see a little Ollama icon in your menu bar (top-right)

Pull and run a model
In your terminal:

ollama pull llama3
ollama run llama3


The first pull will download a few GB, so it may take time.

Once running, you should see a REPL where you can type prompts.

Verify server is running
Test with:

curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags


If it lists available models (e.g. llama3), the server is good to go.
